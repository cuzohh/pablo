## 🚀 Usage

Coming soon! Script will be published on TradingView once I'm happy with it, still in development atm.

## 📊 Backtesting & Data

Unfortunately, buying a $600 TradingView plan to backtest this isn't something I can really do as a college student 💀

So data will be collected manually — the old fashioned way.

Daily recaps and performance tracking will be uploaded on the **[Pablo website](https://cuzohh.github.io/pablo/)**
